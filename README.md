ðŸš€ Progress Steps â€“ Mini Project
This mini project is part of my daily coding challenge, where I build small web projects to sharpen my frontend skills.

ðŸ“‹ About the Project
This project demonstrates how to create progress steps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics a multi-step progress tracker often seen in forms, checkouts, and onboarding flows.

The goal was to explore:

How to structure steps using semantic HTML

Styling interactive components with CSS

Manipulating the DOM and managing UI state with JavaScript

ðŸ§  What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced and reinforced the following skills:

DOM Manipulation: Adding/removing active classes based on user interaction

CSS Transitions: Creating smooth visual feedback for progress movement

Responsive Design Basics: Ensuring steps scale and adjust across screen sizes

JavaScript Event Handling: Using event listeners to control UI logic

Code Organization: Keeping HTML clean, CSS modular, and JS functional

ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript
